It has been two months already since the first weekly digest! This is number eight and it will highlight the things that happened around x64dbg this week.

## GUID Reference Searching

Just after I wrote the digest last week, torusrxxx implemented GUID reference searching. It shows various things that might be interesting if you are looking into COM.

## Graph comments

The graph view didn't show much information before. It will now show the same comments as in the disassembly view so you can easily spot string references and such.

## Graph overview

In addition to traced blocks, the graph overview will now show the blocks that end in a `ret` instruction in a different color. This allows you to spot potential function exit points more easily.

## Added some expression functions

You can now use the `dis.next` and `dis.prev` [expression functions](http://x64dbg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction/Expression-functions.html) to get the address of the next/previous instruction. For example you can use the following command to trace until the next instruction is a `ret`.

`TraceIntoConditional dis.isret(dis.next(cip))`

## Cross references dialog

By running the [analx](http://x64dbg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/commands/analysis/analxrefs.html) command x64dbg will do cross reference analysis. Cross references can be viewed by pressing 'X' on the instruction that is referenced. The dialog showing the referencing instructions is now non-modal you can browse around the current reference to see whats there without confirming you want to go there.

## Graph debugging

It is now possible to synchronise the current instruction of the graph with 'Origin' (EIP/RIP). This allows you to do some basic debugging in the graph view!

## Freeze stack has been fixed

Thanks to [shamanas](https://github.com/shamanas) in pull request [#1158](https://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/pull/1158) the freeze stack option now works correctly again!

I would also like to thank [fearless](https://github.com/mrfearless) again for contributing lots of these great icons!

## Fixed complex memory assignments

The expression `1:[x64dbg:EntryPoint]=90` now works like it's supposed to. If you want to find out what it does, check out the manual. Specifically the sections on [input](http://help.x64dbg.com/en/latest/introduction/Input.html) and [expressions](http://help.x64dbg.com/en/latest/introduction/Expressions.html).

## Execute multiple commands

Someone on the [mailing list](mailto:x64dbg@googlegroups.com) (yes that's right) noticed that you cannot execute multiple commands at a time. You can now do that, separating them with a semicolon. **Beware**: commands that interact with the debugger ([step](http://x64dbg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/commands/debug-control/StepOver.html), [run](http://x64dbg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/commands/debug-control/run.html) and [rtr](http://x64dbg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/commands/debug-control/StepOut.html) for instance) will not be executed like scripts! Doing `eax=0;step;eax++` does not guarantee that `eax++` is executed after the step finished.

## x64dbgbinja

After the [x64dbgida](https://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbgida) plugin, there is now the [x64dbgbinja](https://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbgbinja) plugin that allows you to import/export x64dbg databases with [Binary Ninja](https://binary.ninja). Also thanks to the team there for providing me with a license so I could actually test the plugin!

## Refactor

There has been quite some refactoring going on. Most notably the [command callbacks](https://x64dbg.com/blog/2016/10/04/architecture-of-x64dbg.html#commands-dispatch) no longer require `CMDRESULT` as return type (making it even easier to write commands) and the [CPUStack](https://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/blob/33024f567230620eaa5cd5188b0c0f2c9903e1a9/src/gui/Src/Gui/CPUStack.cpp#L79) has been refactored to use the [MenuBuilder](https://x64dbg.com/blog/2016/10/04/architecture-of-x64dbg.html#context-menu-management) to save lots of development time in the long run.

## Tracing plugins

[Tracing](https://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/issues/790) has been a much requested feature for x64dbg. The [x64_tracer](https://github.com/KurapicaBS/x64_tracer) plugin by [KurapicaBS](https://github.com/KurapicaBS) implemented a trace plugin, but you can now register the [CB_TRACEEXECUTE](http://help.x64dbg.com/en/latest/developers/plugins/Callbacks/plugcbtraceexecute.html) callback to receive callback on every step of a trace. An example plugin that stops every tracer after 20 000 steps is available [here](https://github.com/mrexodia/TracePlugin).
